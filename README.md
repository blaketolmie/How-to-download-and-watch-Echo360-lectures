# Echo360 Downloader and Viewer

## Downloading Lectures from Echo360

To download your lectures from Echo360:

1. Clone the downloader tool using:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ronandalton/echo360-downloader.git 
2. Export your course cookies, [Export All Cookies](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) using the "Get Cookies.txt" Chrome extension. Place the cookies.txt file in the `echo360-downloader` folder.  
3. Run the main.py file and provide the Echo360 course link when prompted. The script will automatically download all lectures from the course using the cookies.txt file downloaded from (2).  
Lectures will be neatly organized into separate folders, e.g., Lecture 1, Lecture 2, etc.  
  
> To download multiple courses at once, use the terminal:  
    ```bash
    python main.py -o "C:\Users\911BL\OneDrive - University of Canterbury\Lectures 2024\ENME203" -c "ENME203.txt"  

> Make sure to update the course-specific cookies.txt file and output directory accordingly.  

## Watching Downloaded Videos
For dual-source lectures (such as slides and video streams):

Download a dual-video player to play both sources of the lecture synchronously.
To view only one source while maintaining sync, double-click on the video you want to make fullscreen. Double-click again to return to dual view.
To replicate the view of Echo360, change the aspect ratio to "None".
